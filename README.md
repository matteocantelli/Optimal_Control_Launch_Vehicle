# Optimal_Control_Launch_Vehicle
This project implements a Deep Q-Network in MATLAB to optimize a rocket's vertical ascent in 2D. By modeling variable mass dynamics and wind disturbances, the agent autonomously learned the energy-efficient Bang-Coast strategy. The system successfully guides the vehicle to a 100m target, minimizing fuel use and correcting lateral errors.
